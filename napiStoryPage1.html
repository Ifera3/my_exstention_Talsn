        Napi chose a large area of land, East of the Rockies. He put on there, all the different animals that walk on mother Earth, the water animals, the ones that fly. He built the rivers and landmarks in this area and they were all named in Blackfoot. When He came to build, put the buffalo on Mother Earth, all the rest would kill another, eat one another. “But the buffalo,” He said tohimself, “I should put on Mother Earth, people similar to me, so they can make use of the buffalo.” This naturalarea had natural boundaries. To the South was the Yellowstone River and to the West was the Rocky Mountains, as far North as the Saskatchewan River, East to the Cyprus Hills.
